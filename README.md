#  Description: 

In this project, the main goal is to **build a movie recommendation engine** using a powerful machine learning approach called **Collaborative Filtering**. More specifically, we’re using a technique known as **Matrix Factorization**, and the algorithm behind the scenes is called **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.

# Working:

Imagine you have a huge spreadsheet where rows are users and columns are movies, and the cells are filled with ratings users gave to movies they’ve watched. But here’s the twist — most of the spreadsheet is empty, because no one watches everything!

That’s where **SVD** comes in. It helps us fill in those missing values by figuring out hidden patterns — like a user’s love for action films or a movie’s romantic vibe. It breaks the big messy matrix into smaller, more meaningful pieces (called **latent factors**) to predict what each user might like next.

Once the model is trained, it can look at a movie a user hasn’t rated and say, “Hey, based on your past ratings, I think you’d give this a 4.5.” Based on those predictions, we can recommend the **top movies** that the user hasn't seen yet — personalized just for them.

And to make sure the model’s not just making random guesses, we use evaluation metrics like **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to check how close the predicted ratings are to the real ones.

# Tools Used:

We built the whole project in **Python**, using some great data science libraries:

* **Pandas**: Helps us load and manage the rating data — like putting it into neat tables we can work with.
* **Scikit-Surprise**: This is the superstar of recommendation systems in Python. It gives us the SVD algorithm, tools to split the data, and ways to evaluate how good our model is.
* **NumPy**: Works quietly in the background for numerical tasks.



# Platform:

The project lives in a **Jupyter Notebook** — the go-to platform for data science. It lets us write code, see results immediately, and explain things in plain text alongside the code. Whether you run it on **Google Colab**, **JupyterLab**, or **VS Code**, it's interactive and beginner-friendly.

# Real-World Applications — Why This Matters

Recommendation engines like the one we built are the **backbone of personalized experiences** on the internet. You’ve definitely used one — here’s where they show up:

*  **Netflix & YouTube** — Suggesting the next show or video based on what you’ve watched.
*  **Spotify** — Creating playlists that seem to read your mind.
*  **Amazon & Flipkart** — Recommending products you didn’t know you needed.
*  **Goodreads or Kindle** — Helping you discover your next favorite book.
